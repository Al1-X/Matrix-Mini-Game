  <h3> Description </h3>
The goal of the project was to create a mini-game which comes with a fully functional menu. The game consists of a 8x8 board (represented by the 8x8 matrix), on which the player (cat) must move with the joystick in order to catch the appearing blinking dot (mouse).

The score increases with each dot reached and is printed on the LCD. If the button is pressed while playing, the game ends and a quit message is shown. If pressed one more time, the stats of the player are shown.
